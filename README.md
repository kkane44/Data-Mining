# Data-Mining
This repo contains the final project completed in the course Data Mining during graduate school.
## Introduction
This project delves into the world of higher education data, aiming to uncover insightful patterns pertaining to student academic success and the likelihood to continue educational paths. The central objective is to predict whether undergraduate students will drop out, enroll, or graduate upon completing a full academic year. The report structure is organized into distinct sections, beginning with a detailed dataset description and attribute analysis. Subsequently, data preparation and preprocessing steps are executed to ensure robustness. An initial exploratory data analysis follows, shedding light on correlations and trends within the data. The methodology involves employing classification data mining techniques, including the Random Forest, J48, Random Tree, and IBk algorithms, to decode intricate relationships between student demographics, curricular unit performance, and enrollment statuses. These analyses cater to the classification categories: "Dropout," "Enrolled," and "Graduate." Notably, the Random Forest algorithm emerges as the top performer in accuracy.
